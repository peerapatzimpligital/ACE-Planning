# EPIC ACE-31: Inbound Flow PR / Branch Breakdown

This document provides a breakdown of tasks into small, manageable Pull Requests (PRs) or branches for **Sequence 1: Inbound Flow** of EPIC-ACE-31 (NDP-01 to NDP-05). It excludes the basic tenant and channel account setup (which belongs to EPIC-ACE-30 / FND-01) to ensure each PR is small, easy to review, and allows for parallel development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Reference Documents** — All implementation must align with these consolidated epic-level specs:
>
> | Document | Description |
> |---|---|
> | [epic-api-table.md](./epic-api-table.md) | Consolidated API surface — endpoints, request/response contracts, pagination conventions |
> | [epic-er-diagram.md](./epic-er-diagram.md) | Consolidated ER diagram — all entities, fields, indexes, unique constraints |
> | [epic-sequence.md](./epic-sequence.md) | Consolidated sequence diagrams — inbound/outbound/query flows, SQS config, PII redaction rules |

## 🗄️ Stage 1: Database & Internal API (Data Layer for NDP)
**Target Projects:** `omnichat-service` and Shared schema
**Goal:** Prepare database tables and internal APIs to receive data from the normalization worker.

- [x] **PR 1.1: NDP Database Schema**
    - **Tasks:** Create schema definitions and migrations specifically for `Contacts`, `Conversations`, `Messages`, `Attachments`, and `RawEvents` tables.
    - **Review Focus:** Unique constraints for idempotency (preventing duplicate processing) and indexes for cursor-based pagination.

- [x] **PR 1.2: Raw Events API**
    - **Tasks:** Implement `POST /raw-events` (to persist the original webhook payload) and `PATCH /raw-events/:id` (to update the normalization status upon failure).

- [x] **PR 1.3: Inbound Persistence API (Core Logic)**
    - **Tasks:** Implement `POST /messages/inbound`.
    - **Review Focus:** Resolution logic: `UPSERT` Contact -> Create or retrieve Conversation using `fallback_thread_key` -> `INSERT` Message (Idempotent).

## 🚪 Stage 2: Webhook Gateway (Entry Point)
**Target Project:** `omnichat-gateway`
**Goal:** Receive webhooks from external channels (LINE, FB, etc.), validate them quickly, and push them to the message queue.

- [x] **PR 2.1: Webhook Controller & Security**
    - **Tasks:** Create a unified `POST /webhooks/:channel` controller.
    - **Review Focus:** Signature validation middleware (HMAC-SHA256) and Rate Limiting logic.

- [x] **PR 2.2: SQS Producer & Deduplication**
    - **Tasks:** Implement logic to publish payloads to an AWS SQS FIFO queue.
    - **Review Focus:** Correct configuration of `MessageGroupId` (to maintain order per channel/user) and `DeduplicationId` (`SHA256(payload)`) to prevent processing duplicate webhook deliveries.

## ⚙️ Stage 3: Normalization Pipeline (Core Processing)
**Target Project:** `omnichat-normalizer-worker`
**Goal:** Consume messages from the queue, redact PII, normalize the payload structure, and forward it to Stage 1 APIs for persistence.

- [x] **PR 3.1: SQS Consumer Setup & PII Redactor**
    - **Tasks:** Set up the SQS Consumer (Long-polling 20s, batch size of 10) and implement the initial PII redaction layer.
    - **Review Focus:** Consumer configuration and error safety in redaction.

- [ ] **PR 3.2: Channel Mappers (Strategy Pattern)**
    - **Tasks:** Implement transformation logic (starting with one channel, e.g., LINE) to map raw payloads into the standard `NormalizedEvent Contract`.
    - **Review Focus:** Usage of the Strategy Pattern to ensure extensibility for future channels, and support for marketplace metadata (`source_category`: chat, order_reference, fetch_history).

- [ ] **PR 3.3: Worker Orchestration (Workflow Stitching)**
    - **Tasks:** Integrate PR 3.1 and 3.2 into the main workflow.
    - **Sub-flow:**
        1. Call PR 1.2 (Save Raw Event).
        2. Attempt payload normalization.
        3. On Success -> Call PR 1.3 (Save Inbound Payload) -> Acknowledge (delete message from queue).
        4. On Failure -> Call PATCH to log the error -> Process next message in the queue (Failure Isolation).

## 📎 Stage 4: Async Attachment Processing
**Target Projects:** `file-service`, `omnichat-service`, `omnichat-normalizer-worker`
**Goal:** Offload image/video/audio downloads and uploads to an asynchronous flow, preventing bottlenecks in the main text message processing pipeline.

- [ ] **PR 4.1: Internal Upload API (`file-service`)**
    - **Tasks:** Implement `POST /files/upload` to receive binary files, upload them to a public S3 bucket, and return a static `file_url`.

- [ ] **PR 4.2: Attachment Tracking APIs (`omnichat-service`)**
    - **Tasks:** Implement `POST /attachments` (to create a record with a `pending` status) and `PATCH /attachments/:id` (to update the `file_url`, size, `retry_count`, `failure_reason`, and ultimate status upon completion or error).

- [ ] **PR 4.3: Async Downloader (`omnichat-normalizer-worker`)**
    - **Tasks:** Add logic after PR 3.3: If a message contains attachments, trigger an API to download the file from the channel network -> Validate Size/MIME type -> Send to PR 4.1 -> Update status using PR 4.2.
    - **Review Focus:** Max file size limitations, retry backoff logic (e.g., max 3 retries on network failures), and correct status transitions (`pending` -> `uploading` -> `uploaded` or `failed`/`rejected`).

---

## 🔍 Stage 5: Core Query APIs (For Inbox UI)
**Target Projects:** `api-gateway`, `omnichat-service`
**Goal:** Provide APIs to serve data to the Inbox UI or downstream AI processes.

- [ ] **PR 5.1: Conversations List API**
    - **Tasks:** Implement `GET /api/v1/conversations` (to populate the recent chats list).
    - **Review Focus:** Cursor-based pagination on `last_message_at` and correct JOIN logic with the Contacts table.

- [ ] **PR 5.2: Message Timeline API**
    - **Tasks:** Implement `GET /api/v1/conversations/:id/messages` (to populate the chat window).
    - **Review Focus:** Cursor-based pagination on `created_at` and accurately merging the static `file_url` for any associated attachments into the response.

> **💡 Tips for Parallel Development**
> - The team can start working on **Stage 1 (Database & APIs)**, **Stage 2 (Webhook)**, and **Stage 4.1 (File Upload)** concurrently. The developers working on Stage 2 can mock SQS publishing during testing.
> - Once Stage 1 is unblocked, the team can immediately proceed with **Stage 3 (Normalizer Worker)**.
